# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- `--gate` with a metric missing from the report now fails (exit 2) instead of passing silently; opt out with `--allow-missing-gates`. Malformed gate specs give a CLI error rather than a traceback.
- `--export pdf|svg|png` writes every applicable plot (`breakdown`, `topk`, `traffic_delta`, `skew`, `roofline`, `scaling`); keys in the returned dict are now `"<ext>:<kind>"`.
- `report.json` now also contains `details` and `scalars`.
- `compare --manifest` honors `--warmup-steps`, `--max-steps`, `--collective-algo`, `--alpha` and `--cache-dir` as overrides, and warns when positional traces are ignored.
- Inapplicable plot kinds no longer leak open Matplotlib figures.
- README plugin example matches the real registry API.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** requires Python >=3.11 and protobuf >=6.31.1. Chakra-ET parsing now uses the official `mlc-chakra` schema from the pinned `third_party/chakra` git submodule (PyPI 1.0.0 predates storage/data-op nodes) instead of the vendored copy. Clone with `--recurse-submodules`. A path dependency means this package cannot be uploaded to PyPI as is.

### Added
- Chakra `STORAGE_NODE` and `DATA_OP_NODE` nodes are ingested as `op_class` `storage` / `data_op` (storage size taken from the typed fs/page/block detail).
- `cta --version`, `python -m cta`, `cta list`, `--format json|rich` and `--alpha` on `compare`/`analyze`, `--warmup-steps`/`--max-steps` on `plot`.
- `py.typed` marker, Python 3.13 in CI and classifiers.
- Version is single-sourced from `cta/__init__.py` (hatch dynamic version).
